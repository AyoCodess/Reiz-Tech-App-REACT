## My experience and considerations

I had a great time building this application, I had to spend some time thinking about the pagination implementation. I'm sure the pagination architecture could be improved with a little guidance from a more experienced dev.

I opted to avoid context API and chose to pop drill as the app is still relatively small. Context is generally not that efficient at this point in time. If we wanted to add a host of new filter options I would opt to use redux in that case.
